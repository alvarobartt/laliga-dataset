## Introduction

As [LaLiga](https://www.laliga.es/) does not have a public API, I have decided to develop a web scraper in order to retrieve information from LaLiga players and their performance through the past season (2018/19) so that any Data Scientist or Data Enthusiastic can handle it and abstract their own conclusions and research.

## Additional Information

This dataset has been generated from [LaLiga](https://www.laliga.es/) available data on player statistics and performance on the past season (2018/19). The motivation of this project is completely focused on research purposes and so on both the Jupyter Notebook and consequently the dataset are going to be improved and more data will be added if possible.
